# Changelog

## v0.0.2 — 2026-03-22

### Unified Output Specification

- **pipeline.yml output block**: 6 semantic slots (discussions, plans, milestones, backlog, reviews, analyses) with sensible defaults. Replaces old `output.review` + `output.plans`.
- **Scratch persistence**: All skill outputs auto-save to `~/.claude/scratch/<project-hash>/` for session resilience. Survives compact/crash/close.
- **Persistence prompts**: High-value skills (trace, consensus, think) ask user to formally save after completion. Low-ceremony skills (code-review, team) save silently, archived in bulk during `/ae:review`.
- **Session recovery**: All skills with pre-checks now scan scratch for `status: in_progress` items and prompt user to resume.
- **Action log format**: code-review findings tracked with action (fix now / backlog / skip) and status (pending / in_progress / resolved).
- **Unified naming**: `NNN-slug` convention with YAML frontmatter (`id`, `title`, `type`, `created`, `status`) across all file-writing skills.
- **cross-family-review**: Moved from `skills/` to `docs/` — it's a reference document, not a slash command.

### Component counts
- 12 skills (was 13 — cross-family-review moved to docs)
- 13 agents
- 2 MCP servers
