# Changelog

## v0.0.5 — 2026-03-23

### Features
- **Agent Teams pre-check**: All 9 skills that use Agent Teams now check `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` is enabled before executing — refuses with actionable instructions if missing
- **Setup detects Agent Teams**: `/ae:setup` checks and reports Agent Teams status during initialization
- **README updated**: Prerequisites section documents Agent Teams requirement with setup instructions

## v0.0.4 — 2026-03-22

### Fixes
- **Gemini MCP startup**: Move dep install from SessionStart hook into `.mcp.json` command — fixes race condition where MCP connection started before `npm install` finished
- **GEMINI_API_KEY passthrough**: Add `env` block to `.mcp.json` so the key is forwarded to the Gemini server process

## v0.0.3 — 2026-03-22

### Improvements
- **Agent auto-discovery**: Skills discover agents at runtime from all sources (project, plugins, global) — no need to list agents in pipeline.yml
- **Gemini model auto-discovery**: New `models` tool lists available models via API, agents pick models at runtime. Removed `gemini_model` from pipeline.yml.
- **Auto-setup on first use**: Skills auto-trigger `/ae:setup` when pipeline.yml is missing instead of refusing to execute
- **Review findings fixed**: testgen field name bug, review empty test.command, code-review scratch status, think scratch recovery
- **Proxy failure deadlock fix**: Proxies now notify the team lead (not Lead) on failure, preventing hang
- **Scratch project isolation**: frontmatter `project` field + recovery filters by repo name
- **dist/ included in repo**: Gemini MCP server works immediately on plugin install without build step

## v0.0.2 — 2026-03-22

### Unified Output Specification

- **pipeline.yml output block**: 6 semantic slots (discussions, plans, milestones, backlog, reviews, analyses) with sensible defaults. Replaces old `output.review` + `output.plans`.
- **Scratch persistence**: All skill outputs auto-save to `~/.claude/scratch/<project-hash>/` for session resilience. Survives compact/crash/close.
- **Persistence prompts**: High-value skills (trace, consensus, think) ask user to formally save after completion. Low-ceremony skills (code-review, team) save silently, archived in bulk during `/ae:review`.
- **Session recovery**: All skills with pre-checks now scan scratch for `status: in_progress` items and prompt user to resume.
- **Action log format**: code-review findings tracked with action (fix now / backlog / skip) and status (pending / in_progress / resolved).
- **Unified naming**: `NNN-slug` convention with YAML frontmatter (`id`, `title`, `type`, `created`, `status`) across all file-writing skills.
- **cross-family-review**: Moved from `skills/` to `docs/` — it's a reference document, not a slash command.

### Component counts
- 12 skills (was 13 — cross-family-review moved to docs)
- 13 agents
- 2 MCP servers
