# Changelog

## v0.1.0 — 2026-03-30

### Dynamic Agent Selection
- **Centralized agent selection**: `skills/agent-selection/SKILL.md` — unified selection table referenced by all 12 Agent Teams skills
- **Context-aware team composition**: TL selects agents based on task context signals, not hardcoded lists
- **Cross-family as external experts**: TL decides review angle, proxy assembles full prompt (two-layer assembly)
- **Auto-pass default ON**: gate passes → auto-continue, pause only on exception. Removed `--auto N`.

### Challenger Format
- **Structured disagreement**: Claim/Evidence/Objection/Confidence — no free-form challenges
- **Disagreement Value Assessment**: tracks which challenges changed conclusions

### /ae:work Rewrite
- **Inline drift detection**: contract extraction moved into pre-commit (no separate phase)
- **Execution flow diagram**: top of file for agent orientation
- **Pre-commit checks A-G**: letter labels, contract verification, disposition efficiency

### Knowledge Management
- **docs/references/**: external sources with borrowed/discarded rationale
- **NykDev framework analysis**: "Agreement is a bug" comparison
- **docs/backlog/**: 6 tracked items for future work

### Component counts
- 14 skills (was 13 — added agent-selection contextual skill), 13 agents, 2 MCP servers

## v0.0.9 — 2026-03-30

### Discussion Convergence
- **Three-state scoring**: topics scored as converged/revisit/deferred (no irresolvable escape)
- **Multi-round discussion**: no fixed round limit, revisit until convergence
- **Sweep mechanism**: all deferred items must resolve before conclusion — converge, spawn new discussion, or explain why
- **Topic directory structure**: `summary.md` + `round-NN.md` per topic, agent only reads summary each round (O(1) context vs O(n))
- **Process Metadata**: auto-embedded in conclusion, makes incomplete process visible
- **Downstream validation**: `/ae:plan` checks conclusion completeness

### Harness Phase 3
- **Doodlestein challenge**: cross-family 3-question challenge (Smartest Alternative / Problem Validity / Regret Prediction) at discuss conclusion and plan confirm
- **Outcome statistics**: `/ae:review` reports rework rate, P1 escape rate, drift events, auto-pass rate
- **Auto-pass default ON**: gate passes → auto-continue, pause only on exception. Removed `--auto N` parameter.

### Challenger Improvements
- **Structured disagreement**: challenges must use Claim/Evidence/Objection/Confidence format
- **Disagreement Value Assessment**: tracks which challenges changed conclusions vs dismissed

### Documentation
- **docs/references/**: knowledge sources with what we borrowed, discarded, and why
- **NykDev framework analysis**: compared "Agreement is a bug" 11-agent framework with ae

### Component counts
- 13 skills, 13 agents, 2 MCP servers

## v0.0.8 — 2026-03-29

### Harness Improvement Phase 2
- **Contract extraction**: `/ae:work` extracts `files_allowed` and `target_ac` from plan's "Expected files:" before each step. Graceful degradation when plan lacks this field.
- **Drift verification**: Post-step `git diff --name-only` checked against contract. Violations trigger soft pause with fix/approve/rollback options. Approved drifts recorded in commit message.
- **Auto-pass gate** (opt-in): When `work.auto_pass: true` in pipeline.yml, steps auto-continue if tests green + no P1 + contract verified. Contract violations and security-sensitive files always force pause.
- **Pipeline config**: `work.max_fix_loops`, `work.auto_pass`, `work.security_patterns` added to pipeline template
- **Plan template**: Steps now include "Expected files:" line for contract extraction

## v0.0.7 — 2026-03-29

### Harness Improvement Phase 1
- **Fix loop circuit breaker**: `/ae:work` TDD cycle detects consecutive test failures on same file, stops after 3 (configurable) with retry/defer/help options
- **Git diff transparency**: `/ae:work` shows `git diff --stat` before each commit for drift visibility
- **Disposition efficiency**: Pre-commit auto-skips P3 and P2-style/naming findings, only shows P1 + P2-logic/security
- **Plan quality self-check**: `/ae:plan` verifies step completion conditions, AC verifiability, and expected file lists before review
- **Discussion decision self-check**: `/ae:discuss` requires rationale, reversibility rating, and evidence for each decision

### Documentation
- **Discussion 002**: Harness improvement discussion with 2 rounds of Agent Team review (conclusion + plan)
- **Plan 002**: 3-phase implementation plan for evaluation criteria, automation gates, drift detection

## v0.0.6 — 2026-03-23

### Features
- **`/ae:plan-review`**: Standalone plan review command — re-review an existing plan with Agent Teams without regenerating it

### Component counts
- 13 skills (was 12), 13 agents, 2 MCP servers

## v0.0.5 — 2026-03-23

### Features
- **Agent Teams pre-check**: All 9 skills that use Agent Teams now check `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` is enabled before executing — refuses with actionable instructions if missing
- **Setup detects Agent Teams**: `/ae:setup` checks and reports Agent Teams status during initialization
- **README updated**: Prerequisites section documents Agent Teams requirement with setup instructions

## v0.0.4 — 2026-03-22

### Fixes
- **Gemini MCP startup**: Move dep install from SessionStart hook into `.mcp.json` command — fixes race condition where MCP connection started before `npm install` finished
- **GEMINI_API_KEY passthrough**: Add `env` block to `.mcp.json` so the key is forwarded to the Gemini server process

## v0.0.3 — 2026-03-22

### Improvements
- **Agent auto-discovery**: Skills discover agents at runtime from all sources (project, plugins, global) — no need to list agents in pipeline.yml
- **Gemini model auto-discovery**: New `models` tool lists available models via API, agents pick models at runtime. Removed `gemini_model` from pipeline.yml.
- **Auto-setup on first use**: Skills auto-trigger `/ae:setup` when pipeline.yml is missing instead of refusing to execute
- **Review findings fixed**: testgen field name bug, review empty test.command, code-review scratch status, think scratch recovery
- **Proxy failure deadlock fix**: Proxies now notify the team lead (not Lead) on failure, preventing hang
- **Scratch project isolation**: frontmatter `project` field + recovery filters by repo name
- **dist/ included in repo**: Gemini MCP server works immediately on plugin install without build step

## v0.0.2 — 2026-03-22

### Unified Output Specification

- **pipeline.yml output block**: 6 semantic slots (discussions, plans, milestones, backlog, reviews, analyses) with sensible defaults. Replaces old `output.review` + `output.plans`.
- **Scratch persistence**: All skill outputs auto-save to `~/.claude/scratch/<project-hash>/` for session resilience. Survives compact/crash/close.
- **Persistence prompts**: High-value skills (trace, consensus, think) ask user to formally save after completion. Low-ceremony skills (code-review, team) save silently, archived in bulk during `/ae:review`.
- **Session recovery**: All skills with pre-checks now scan scratch for `status: in_progress` items and prompt user to resume.
- **Action log format**: code-review findings tracked with action (fix now / backlog / skip) and status (pending / in_progress / resolved).
- **Unified naming**: `NNN-slug` convention with YAML frontmatter (`id`, `title`, `type`, `created`, `status`) across all file-writing skills.
- **cross-family-review**: Moved from `skills/` to `docs/` — it's a reference document, not a slash command.

### Component counts
- 12 skills (was 13 — cross-family-review moved to docs)
- 13 agents
- 2 MCP servers
