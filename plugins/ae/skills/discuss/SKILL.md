# /ae:discuss — settle one contested decision

Settle one decision where two defensible options lead to materially different work, so the
plan does not have to guess which one was meant. Nothing contested → skip the stage; a
discussion held as ceremony costs a cycle and decides nothing.

**Input:** the analysis, and one id from its `discuss:` list. You settle the question under that heading, not a neighbouring one you find more interesting.

**Deliverable:** one decision record, a file in `<feature-dir>/`. If this conversation were
lost, the next stage must be able to proceed from that file alone.

## What must be true of the record

- It states the question that was contested, in the terms it was actually posed — not a
  tidier restatement written once the answer was known.
- It states every option that was live and the work each one implies, so a reader can see
  why the question was contested at all.
- It states which option was chosen.
- Its reason is evidence a reader can open: a file and line, a command's output, a quoted
  opinion. "It seems better" is not a reason.
- It shows the losing option argued, not merely listed — what was said against the choice,
  and why that did not win. An objection that vanishes between the argument and the record
  is a process failure.
- It names what would reopen the decision: an observation someone could make, at the far end
  where a wrong choice would actually show. Two documents agreeing with each other establish
  nothing, and restating the decision in the negative names no observation. Where no such
  observation exists, say so plainly — it is a settled preference, and no acceptance
  criterion follows from it.
- It leaves nothing open. Every question the discussion raised is decided here, or stated as
  an assumption together with what would retract it.

The decision itself is yours, including one that changes what a criterion means: the criteria
are not signed yet, and settling this question is why they were not. Edit `acceptance.md` in
place and name the id you moved. Do not carry its old wording into the record — the reason
belongs there, the superseded text belongs nowhere.

If the question can be decided from evidence after all, it was never contested and should not
have been on the list. Settle it and say so, so the misrouting is visible later.

## What the next stage may refuse it for

- A question the discussion opened is still open — there is nothing to plan against.
- The reason cites nothing a reader can open.
- The record exists only in the conversation.
- It changed what a criterion means without changing `acceptance.md` to match.
